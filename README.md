# Gradle Test Examples

This project contains several examples of how to go about setting up and
testing gradle logic. Contributions welcome.

## Why?

Testing gradle can be a real pain. Both the TestKit and the ProcessBuilder are
hard to set up correctly, and most of gradle's API have no way to extract the
information you may want to verify. On top of that the official documentation
may contain code-snippets but lacks comprehensive examples. I find my self
having to solve the same problem over and over again, so this project contains
a few basic setup examples, and how to test them.
